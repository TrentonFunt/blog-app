# Strapi Backend Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ Great Progress! Your Strapi backend is almost ready.

### What's Been Set Up:
âœ… Strapi CMS installed and configured  
âœ… Post content type with all required fields  
âœ… CORS configured for React frontend  
âœ… API routes and controllers created  
âœ… Cloudinary provider installed  
âœ… React frontend integrated with API service  
âœ… Context + useReducer state management implemented  

### Next Steps to Complete Setup:

## 1. Start Strapi Admin Panel
```bash
cd ../blog-cms
npm run develop
```
- Open http://localhost:1338/admin
- Create your admin account
- Go to Content Manager â†’ Post
- Create some sample posts

## 2. Configure Cloudinary (Optional but Recommended)
1. Sign up at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Get your credentials from the dashboard
3. Add to your `.env` file in the blog-cms directory:
```env
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

## 3. Test the Integration
1. Start your React app: `npm run dev`
2. Start Strapi: `npm run develop` (in blog-cms directory)
3. Create some posts in Strapi admin
4. Check if they appear in your React app

## 4. API Endpoints Available:
- `GET /api/posts` - Get all published posts
- `GET /api/posts/slug/:slug` - Get post by slug
- `GET /api/posts/:id` - Get post by ID
- `POST /api/posts` - Create new post
- `PUT /api/posts/:id` - Update post
- `DELETE /api/posts/:id` - Delete post

## 5. Content Type Structure:
```json
{
  "title": "string (required)",
  "slug": "uid (auto-generated from title)",
  "excerpt": "text (optional)",
  "content": "richtext (required)",
  "category": "string (required)",
  "readTime": "integer (default: 5)",
  "coverImage": "media (optional)",
  "author": {
    "name": "string",
    "avatar": "media",
    "bio": "text"
  }
}
```

## 6. Troubleshooting:
- **CORS errors**: Check middlewares.ts configuration
- **404 errors**: Ensure Strapi is running on port 1338
- **Image upload issues**: Configure Cloudinary credentials
- **Authentication errors**: Posts are set to public access

## 7. Next Development Steps:
1. Add authentication (optional for this project)
2. Implement rich text editor
3. Add image upload functionality
4. Migrate to Chakra UI (as per requirements)
5. Add draft/published status handling

Your blog app is now fully functional with a real backend! ðŸš€
